As the professor and supervisor of Mr. Zhang Fayou, I became accquinted with him in 2012 when he applied for a master's degree as my student. I was relectant to accept him as my student at first when I knew that he had worked for 4 years. I thought he was someone looking for a higher degree to find a better job and had no interest in academics. But things were not like that. he told me that he was not sure wether he was interested in academics or working in industy when he graduated. And in the Graduate School Entrance Examination in 2012, the  high scores in calculus and statistics left me with good impression,which grew stronger as I got to konw him better.

Throughout his research work Mr. Zhang has displayed an uncanny ability to find creative solutions. With his excellent computer programming skills, he took about one forth coding work in National Science Fondations.() He helped another student of mine to accelerate the speed of calculating and data processing.the running time of the program decreased from more than 400 seconds to about 7 seconds, which showed that he not only had a deep understanding in the models and displayed abilities to write effective programs. Some doctoral candidates asked him to
