As the professor and supervisor of Mr. Zhang Fayou, I became accquinted with him in 2012 when he applied for a master's degree as my student. I was reluctant to accept him as my student at first when I knew that he had worked for 4 years. I thought he was someone looking for a higher degree to find a better job and had no interest in academics. But things were not like that. he told me that he was not sure whether he was interested in academics or working in industry when he graduated. Fortunately he found out what interested him most. In the Graduate School Entrance Examination in 2012, the  high scores in calculus and statistics left me with good impression,which grew stronger as I got to know him better.

Throughout his research work Mr. Zhang has displayed an uncanny ability to find creative solutions. With his excellent computer programming skills, he took about one forth coding work in National Science Fondations.() He helped another student of mine to accelerate the speed of calculating and data processing.the running time of the program decreased from more than 400 seconds to about 7 seconds, which showed that he not only had a deep understanding in the models and displayed abilities to write effective programs. even some doctoral candidates asked him to

Dear sir or Madam,
It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Mr. Zhang Fayou, one of my favorite student, to support his application to your graduate school for admission and financial aid.

During the course of Optimization Algorithms for Management, Zhang Fayou showed an deep understanding of heuristic algorithms and exhibited good programming habits. He impressed me through the first assignment which required a piece of source code to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) using simulated annealing algorithm. He submitted a well-documented, clear source code, in which its function and variable names were meaningful and easy to understand, 显示出他具有和计算机专业的学生有同样的素养 making me thought that he had a CS major. In his program, he explored how initial temperature and cool down factor would affect the performance of the algorithm, which showed his profound understanding of the algorithm.


In addition, he was among the most approachable student in my class, always very accommodating to others. some of the student were not good at programming, some of them had difficulties in understanding the algorithm, he would be very happy to discuss with them.

I would like to firmly support his quest for more advanced studies in your department. I would greatly appreciate it if you decide to accept Mr. Zhang Fayou as he wishes.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Li Xiangyong
