The decision to quit my job to further my education may be the most important moment in my life. After 5 years of reflection, I found that I am interested in Computer Science, to be more specific, in machine learning. My working experience and the problems I encountered urged me to back to school.

One problem in my work was that the product of my company could not arrive to customers in time. Because the product is sensitive to the temperature, the warehouse of our customer is small, making it very important to predict when the product is used up, and what is the best time to send a new batch of product. the perfect scenario is that the tank truck arrives when the product is used up. However, So many times I saw the driver waiting for the consumption because we send more than the warehouse's capacity, Or, the construction of the high speed railways had to stop because of the lack of our product. It is because of this that I felt an urgent need to further my study.

I am fortunately admitted to Tongji University and chose supply chain management as my major. In the first year, I became a voracious reader to study every techniques I met, from economic order quantity(EOQ) algorithm to ARIMA models. In the **Management Information Systems**, I learned about machine learning algorithms, which brought me a brand new world.
