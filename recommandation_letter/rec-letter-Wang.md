Dear Admission Officer,

I am writing with pleasure to recommend Mr. Zhang Fayou for acceptance into your department. As the teacher of Management Information System, Zhang impressed me for his eagerness to learn machine learning algorithms and his ability for learning fast.

After one class when I presented machine learning algorithms, and made a demo for the students, Zhang showed great interest and asked me to introduce more in the class. I told him that I could not due to the schedule of the class, but if he was really interested, I would make it as his assignment. He agreed and in his presentation, he shared the support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and made a demo, in which he clearly explained what is SVM and how it works. From the source code he submitted, Zhang displayed great programming skills and his knowledge on optimization. he did not solve the problem using any existing SVM packages, but wrote his own methods. He explained this on one conversation that although it seemed time-consuming, he could have deeper understandings on the algorithms. Indeed, Zhang did not have a Computer Science major, But his passions to learn and ability of learning fast would made him competitive in this filed.

I shall really appreciate it if you could accept him into your department, thus further his study on this filed to realize his dreams.

Yours Sincerely
Associate Prof. Wang
