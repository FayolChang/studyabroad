Dear Sir or Madam,
As the professor and supervisor of Mr. Zhang Fayou, I became acquainted with him in 2012 when he applied for a master's degree as my student. I was reluctant to accept him as my student at first when I knew that he had worked for 4 years. I thought he was someone looking for a higher degree to find a better job and had no interest in academics. But things were not like that. he told me that he was not sure whether he was interested in academics or working in industry when he graduated. Fortunately he found out what interested him most. In the Graduate School Entrance Examination in 2012, the  high scores in calculus and statistics left me with good impression, which grew stronger as I got to know him better.

Throughout his research work Mr. Zhang has displayed an uncanny ability to find creative solutions. With his excellent computer programming skills, he took about one forth coding work in my project. He also helped another student of mine to accelerate the speed of calculating and data processing. The running time of the program decreased from more than 400 seconds to about 7 seconds, which showed that he not only had a deep understanding in the models and displayed abilities to write effective programs. Even some doctoral candidates asked him for help about programming.

In addition, he has great passion for study and is always willing to share his knowledge with others. He studied advanced statistics in his spare time and often introduced some statistical method, such as bootstrap, lasso, least angle regression, and some nonparametric inference methods, to other students in my group. He is also interested in optimization, machine learning and started a discussion group, in which each member should give a report about optimization algorithms and discusses their applications in management science.

In his master thesis, he combined DEA efficiency and some machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, to predict corporation's financial failure. The primary result is good.

Indeed, Mr. Zhang is a promising student. I am sure that he will be qualified for your program. I would appreciate it if you could give him your favorable consideration. If you want to know more information about him, please do not hesitate to contact me.
