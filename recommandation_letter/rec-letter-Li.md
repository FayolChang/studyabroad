Dear sir or Madam,

It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Mr. Zhang Fayou, one of my best students, to support his application to your graduate school for admission and financial aid.

During the course of Optimization Algorithms for Management, Zhang Fayou showed a deep understanding of heuristic algorithms and exhibited good programming habits. He impressed me through the first assignment which required a piece of source code to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using simulated annealing algorithm. He submitted a well-documented, clear source code, in which its function and variable names were meaningful and easy to understand, demonstrating that he is as qualified as a CS major student. In his program, he explored how initial temperature and cool down factor would affect the performance of the algorithm, which showed his profound understanding of the algorithm.


In addition, he was among the most approachable students in my class, always very accommodating to others. Some of the student was not good at programming; Zhang explained how the code worked with great patience. When some of his classmates had difficulties in understanding the algorithm, he would be very happy to discuss with them and often linked the algorithms with common sense or their familiar experience to make them understand better.

I would like to firmly support his quest for more advanced studies in your department. I would greatly appreciate it if you decide to accept Mr. Zhang Fayou as he wishes.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Professor Li Xiangyong
Schools of Economics and Management
TongJi University
